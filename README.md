readme template dont judge please

What i want to add to this "game":

Note types: 
 default note -already have
 long note
 mine
 
Note hit logics:
 From osu, when only the earliest reacheble note is considered hitted -already have
 From stepmania, when only the nearest note to chart time is considered hitted
 My own logic, but i havent figured out the logic
 
Supported chart formats:
 osu
 quaver
 stepmania
 
Also i think that i can implement scroll velocities in near future, cant say that about negative sv.
And shizo ideas:
 Read osu replays
 Site for the game(never)

And for the end, this game is the reason why i am is learning programming. For the past 3-4 days all of my time is goes to thinking about things and ways to implement that things. I learned more about programming and c# this week, than for the 5 years of trying to "learn" it. And it is the first time i am writing on english language with minimal usage of translator! I hope, in the future i am still gonna continue learn programming.
